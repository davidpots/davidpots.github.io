title:        PodCrawler
subtitle:     iTunes podcast search, made easy
description:  "Inspired by Marco Arment's Preview.fm project, I created PodCrawler to give users an elegant and no-nonsense experience for searching iTunes podcasts. PodCrawler was built on Rails, using the Feedzirra and iTunes-API gems to retrieve and parse feeds. If you are ever in quick need of the website, RSS feed, or iTunes address of a podcast â€“ there's no better tool for the job than PodCrawler."
