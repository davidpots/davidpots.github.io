subtitle:     A curated podcast mixtape of my favorite episodes
description:  I built Pots Podcast Picks in order to more easily share my favorite podcast episodes with friends and family. My curated selection of favorite episodes is available not just through a website, but also through an RSS feed and even the iTunes Podcast directory. Using Jekyll as a publishing tool, any new episode I add is immediately made available through these means. Now, friends and family whom I recommend podcasts to have one less reason to listen.
