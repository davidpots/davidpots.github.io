title:        GIF Parade
subtitle:     Combine Multiple Animated GIFs with YouTube Audio
description:  Inspired by Garrett Miller's LoudGIF, I created GIF Parade to figure out how to display not one, but multiple animated GIFs in succession backed by audio from a YouTube track. This also served as a terrific playground to further my Javascript skills while also delving into using the Bit.ly and YouTube APIs for the first time.
