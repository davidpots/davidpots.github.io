title:        Wisp
subtitle:     Ultra-Lightweight HTML/CSS Starter Kit
description:  Wisp is an ultra-lightweight HTML framework to help you quickstart any project or rapid prototype. Quite simply, it sets up a generic project directory with an index.html file already linked to the usual CSS and jQuery resources. For simple projects where Rails or the HTML5 Boilerplate is overkill, Wisp helps you hit the ground running without any overhead.
