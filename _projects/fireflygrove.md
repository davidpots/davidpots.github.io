title:        Firefly Grove
subtitle:     Personal songwriting project
description:  Firefly Grove is a personal songwriting project showcasing 9 lo-fi folk songs I wrote &amp; recorded dating back to 2008-2009. From a technical viewpoint, I used this project as an opportunity to introduce myself with the Soundcloud API & SDK while also writing some jQuery layout solutions from scratch.
