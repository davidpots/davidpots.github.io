title: Song Notes
subtitle: Curated digital songbook & video lessons
description: I designed & developed Song Notes to help me share my growing collection of curated guitar tabs, chords, lyrics, and video lessons with aspiring musicians across the world. To do this, I built a Rails-powered CMS that feeds my hand-crafted song metadata snippets into a carefully designed framework that was built to support the structure of any song. The content for each song entry is hand-crafted by me personally, ensuring a high-quality, consistent, and media-rich experience that works for today's web-native audience.
