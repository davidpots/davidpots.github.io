subtitle:     Guitar Tutorials &amp; Instruction via YouTube
description:  In November 2013, feeling inspired by the YouTube stars Justin Sandercoe and Marty Schwartz, I began creating high quality video lessons to accompany and enrich the content my Songnotes website. In 8 weeks, I recorded 15+ video lessons showing in precise detail how to play some of the popular songs on Songnotes. After six months, the videos had generated over 500k views, 3.5k subscribers, and maintained an average viewership of 3 minutes per video.
