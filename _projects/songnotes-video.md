description:  In November 2013, feeling inspired by the YouTube stars Justin Sandercoe and Marty Schwartz, I began creating high quality video lessons to accompany and enrich the content my Songnotes website. I've created over 30 lessons so far, with 10k subscribers and over 1 million total views across all videos. As of late 2016, I've been adding a few new lessons each month.
