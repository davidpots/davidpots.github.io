<h2 id="about-this-song">About this song</h2>

<p>Obviously, this is a song you typically hear played on the guitar – but while learning it on guitar, I happened to be going through a ukulele phase and couldn’t help but figure it out on that instrument too. I figured, why not share what I’d learned! I find it’s a bit simpler on the ukulele: lots of little embellishments I add while playing on the guitar aren’t needed (or aren’t even practically possible) on the ukulele – so it makes for a nice cut and dry song. You only need five chords.</p>

<h2 id="strumming-pattern">Strumming pattern</h2>

<p>I would start with four simple down strums, one on each beat (and repeat that). If you want to get a little bit spicier, I recommend this – where the accents come on beats 2 and 4.</p>

...I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
A                     G      D     A
...With the sword and pistol by my side
Em        Bm                  A             G
...Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Em        Bm               A                G
...Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
Bm              A              G         A      D
...The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
    G            A
But I am still alive


Bm         A                 G             Bm
...I was a sailor, and I was born upon the tide
A               G     D    A
...And with the sea I did abide
Em            Bm                  A           G
...I sailed a schooner around the horn of Mexico
Em         Bm               A             G
...I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
Bm              A                    G        A     D
...And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
    G           A
But I am living still


Bm         A                       G              Bm
...I was a dam builder, across the river deep and wide
A                  G     D       A
...Where steel and water did collide
Em                Bm             A          G
...A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
Em               Bm            A              G
...I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
Bm             A                G         A        D
...They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
    G           A
But I am still around

                    D
    I'll always be around
         A          Bm         A      G    D    Em     G  A  D
    And around and around and around

Bm            A                    G          Bm
...I'll fly a starship, across the universe divide
A          G         D     A
...Until I reach the other side
Em             Bm               A           G
...I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Em           Bm           A           G
...Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Bm          A           G      A       D
...Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
G            A
But I will remain

                      D
    And I'll be back again
         A          Bm         A      G    D    Em     G  A  D
    And again, and again, and again
