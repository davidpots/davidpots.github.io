I"ê	<p>A charming little song we have here. Had it stuck in my head for days and knew I wanted to learn it. Fortunately, it is quite simple to play: you only need three chords, and the majority of the song is transitioning between two of them.</p>

VERSE
              G          D              G           G 
    I want to tell you a story the only way that I can
               G         D               G          D 
    I'm just replacing a man that came before------ me
                G                 D           G             D 
    One day the world is going to see another man replacing me
                    G               D              G             D 
    That's just the way it's gotta be, it's always been---- that way

CHORUS
           A                 G           D 
        On the--------- dark side of the moon
           A                 G           D 
        On the--------- dark side of the moon

    ( G / D / G / D )
    I want to love you, I want to pass it on
    I want to give, and give, till it's all gone
    I want to know you, while we have the time
    'Cause that's all I got to leave behind

    ( G / D / G / D )
    I want to love you, I want to pass it on
    I want to give, and give, till it's all gone
    I want to know you, while we have the time
    'Cause that's all we've got to leave behind

        ( A / G / D / D )
        On the--------- dark side of the moon
        On the--------- dark side of the moon

    ( G / D / G / D )
    And when you stumble, you look the other way
    And when you're riding high, Oh lord when you're riding high

        ( A / G / D / D )
        They-------- don't expect you to stay

    ( G / D / G / D )
    I want to love you, I want to pass it on
    I want to give, and give, till it's all gone
    I want to know you, while we have the time
    'Cause that's all I got to leave behind

    ( G / D / G / D )
    I want to love you, I want to pass it on
    I want to give, and give, till it's all gone
    I want to know you, while we have the time
    'Cause that's all we've got to leave behind

        ( A / G / D / D )
        On the--------- dark side of the moon
        On the--------- dark side of the moon
