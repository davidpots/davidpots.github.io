I""<p>While on a recent plane ride, I embarked on a self-imposed quickfire challenge to use Adobe Illustrator to design the text â€œ@davidpotsâ€ (my Twitter username) in the style of the Washington Capitals logo.  I was armed with only 45 minutes and a vector version of the Capitals logo; no internet connection would be at hand for additional assets (such as fonts, etc).</p>

<p>By the end of the plane ride, things worked out great:</p>

<p>Throughout the remainder of the post, Iâ€™d like to share an overview of the approach I took and the Illustrator techniques used to make this happen.  The result is not merely a tutorial, but rather a broad look at some Illustrator skills any user might find helpful in such a situation.</p>

<h3 id="start-with-what-youve-got">Start With What Youâ€™ve Got</h3>

<p>First step when resources are short?  Make the most of what youâ€™ve already got.  While in a perfect world Iâ€™d have access to the font on which the Capitals logo is based, in this case Iâ€™d have to make due with the letters (or rather, shapes) that make up the source logo I was starting with.</p>

<p>Fortunately, â€œCapitalsâ€ and â€œ@davidpotsâ€ have quite a few letters in common.  My first move was to ungroup the shapes in the â€œCapitalsâ€ logo and move all letters that matched into their proper placement in their â€œ@davidpotsâ€ counterpart.</p>

<p>After this first step alone, about half of the letters are already in place.  Whatâ€™s left?  Creating the â€œ@â€, â€œdâ€, â€œvâ€, and â€œoâ€.  Onward we go.</p>

<h3 id="this-shape--that-shape">This Shape + That Shape</h3>

<p>To create the remaining letters, I would have to create custom shapes based on the contours of existing elements. This would ensure the overall look &amp; feel of the logo remained consistent.</p>

<p>Starting with the â€œdâ€, I saw that the base contours Iâ€™d need already existed in the â€œcâ€ and the â€œlâ€.  Through combining these two objects, the resulting â€œdâ€ would retain the general shape of these other letters.</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/03-making-the-d.png" /></p>

<p>So far so good.  While the remaining letters wouldnâ€™t necesarily be as simple to create, the basic premise &amp; approach would be the same.</p>

<h3 id="take-this-tweak-that-and-drop-the-rest">Take This, Tweak That, and Drop the Rest</h3>

<p>Next up is the letter â€œvâ€.  After a momentâ€™s investigation, it seemed the best way to recreate the bottom point of the â€œvâ€ (with existing elements of â€œCapitalsâ€) is through the upper-right corner of the letter â€œpâ€.</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/04-spotting-the-v-corner.png" /></p>

<p>Unlike the creation of the â€œdâ€, this would require a bit more work.  Instead of simply combining two separate letters to create a third, I would instead be transforming &amp; tweaking part of a letter and then getting rid of the rest.  I did it like this:</p>

<p>First, rotate the â€œpâ€ 180 degreesâ€¦</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/05-p_step_1.png" /></p>

<p>Second, use the direct select tool to increase the height of the left â€œarmâ€</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/06-p_step_2.png" /></p>

<p>Third, use the Pathfinderâ€™s divide function to get rid of excess shape at the top</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/07-p_step_3.png" /></p>

<p>And thatâ€™s it! The â€œvâ€ is ready to be inserted into its namesake.</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/08-p_step_4.png" /></p>

<p>The exact same approach was used to create the â€œoâ€.  Starting with the already-existant â€œpâ€, (1) the shape is divided, as to get rid of the unnecessary bottom stem.  (2) Next, the remaining â€œcornerâ€ is duplicated &amp; rotated 180 degrees.  (3) Finally, the two remaining pieces are moved into place to form the â€œoâ€.  Voila!</p>

<h3 id="round-the-corners--tie-up-loose-ends">Round the Corner(s) &amp; Tie Up Loose Ends</h3>

<p>The final and most challenging letter to create was the â€œ@â€, which would require the most alchemy of the bunch.  In summary, my plan would be to first (1) create the interior shape of the symbol, and second (2) use an external stroke to create the â€œwrap aroundâ€ shape of the symbol â€” this would ensure the curves were 100% right-on. Hereâ€™s how I made it happen:</p>

<h4 id="creating-the-inner-shape">Creating the inner shape</h4>

<p>The first step was creating the inner shape of the â€œ@â€.  Locating all I would need in the base of the â€œdâ€ contour, I simply created a dividing line and used the Pathfinderâ€™s divide tool to make a clean cut:</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/10-at_pt_1.png" /></p>

<h4 id="rounding-the-corners-part-1">Rounding the Corners, Part 1</h4>

<p>So far so good â€” but I realized that I would need to round out the corners on the right-hand side of the shape I created (lest the sharp/jagged run wild and free).  To make this happen, I first (1) spotted an existing corner â€œcurveâ€ in the â€œpâ€, (2) used the Pathfinderâ€™s divide tool to isolate this corner, (3) and finally shifted this over into the contour of my original shape.</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/11-at_pt_2.png" /></p>

<p>Rounding the Corners, Part 2
The previous â€œround the cornerâ€ approach was used one more time for the upper-right corner of the shape.  This time I used an existing corner from the â€œaâ€ to make it happen.  Same basic steps:</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/12-at_pt_3.png" /></p>

<p>Creating the Outer Wrapper
In order to create an outter wrapper for the â€œ@â€, I decided to use the objectâ€™s stroke.  This would ensure the curves remained consistent in both contour and width.  To make this happen, I first (1) gave an exterior stroke to my original object. Next, (2) an additional stroke of then wrapped around the shape again.  Finally, (3) after expanding the strokes into proper shapes (Object &gt; Expand), I used the Pathfinderâ€™s divide tool to get rid of the undesired middle â€œredâ€ section.</p>

<p><img class="img-centered img-white-buffer" src="/images/blog/2009-05-13-hacking-the-washington-capitals-logo-with-illustrator/13-at_pt_4.png" /></p>

<p>Finishing Touches
The very last step involves tweaking the lower-right section of the shape to complete the â€œ@â€ transition.  This involved (1) using the Pathfinderâ€™s divide tool to once again get rid of the undesired portion of the outer wrapper.  (2) Next, I created a small curved shape to join the two shapes, which was (3) moved into place and combined with both shapes to complete the task.</p>

<h3 id="and-were-all-done">And Weâ€™re All Done!</h3>

<p>And there you have it!  All shapes have now been created.  I needed only to align the items as desired and save my final product (which I now proudly wear as my Twitter profile pic in support of the team).</p>

<p>Could this have been arrived at quicker if I had the original â€œCapitalsâ€ font to work with?  Of course!  But that is removed from the point: this was instead about the challenge of a self-imposed quickfire task which forced me to think quickly &amp; make the most of the resources at hand.</p>
