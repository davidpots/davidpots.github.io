<p>Here is a quick, simple tutorial on the steps required to get a new Rails project added to your Github account. Github is a marvelous resource you should certainly be using if youâ€™re messing with Rails. If youâ€™re branding stinking new to Git and donâ€™t have it setup on your machine, check out this Treehouse guide to <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/git-for-designers-part-1">Git for Designers</a> or refer to the official <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Git homepage</a>.</p>

<p>This tutorial assumes you have your development environment setup: git, Rails, rubygems, etc. If you donâ€™t, ask a friend or refer to <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#sec-development_tools">this guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="1-create-a-rails-app">1. Create a rails app</h3>

<p>First, you have to create a new rails app. In terminal, move to the directory where you want to keep your projects and run these commands:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rails new app_name
cd app_name
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Voila, you have created a vanilla Rails app. Now letâ€™s get a Git repository setup.</p>

<h3 id="2-create-a-github-repo">2. Create a github repo</h3>

<p>A git repository (repo) is the online location where our projectâ€™s source files will live. Setting up a new repository is easy:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Visit github.com and login (create an account if youâ€™re new).</li>
  <li>Create a new repository. Name it whatever you want.</li>
</ol>

<p>Nice and easy. Now, we have to point our Rails project to the repo we just created.</p>

<h3 id="3-initiate-git-in-your-app-directory">3. Initiate git in your app directory</h3>

<p>In terminal, change into your new Rails projectâ€™s directory and run the following commands one-at-a-time. This will setup git, add your first commit of code, and properly link your Rails project to your github.com repository.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit."
git remote add origin git@github.com:davidpots/sandbox4.git
git push -u origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thatâ€™s it! Now, as you make changes to your Rails project, youâ€™ll typically commit your changes using the following flow:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git add .
git commit -m "Made changes to this and that"
git push
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And just like that, whatever changes you made will be saved and backed up on github.com.</p>
