<p>Ever have a quick, static HTML site you want to host on Heroku? Well, you can – and quite easily too.</p>

<p>Using Heroku Buildpacks, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create your project directory and project files.</li>
  <li>Create your Git repo as per normal.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Setup Heroku, PHP Buildpack, and .htaccess protection.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>heroku create --remote
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL="https://github.com/digitalpulp/heroku-buildpack-php.git"
touch index.php
heroku config:set ACCESSFILENAME=.htaccess
touch .htaccess-staging
    # Fill it with this, minus this comment
    AuthUserFile /app/www/.htpasswd
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Restricted Access"
    Require valid-user
htpasswd -bc .htpasswd &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit! Sets up app and links it to Heroku."
git push heroku
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="update-october-2015">UPDATE (October 2015)</h3>

<p>Trying to do this again in October 2015, I learned the instructions above didn’t work any longer. Using them as a starting point, I did the following – which ultimately worked. Still TBD is figuring out which of the things below did the trick. Also, I need to make sure I’m not neglecting to include important steps in the new notes below. Will do that all in time.</p>

<h3 id="remove-www-from-the-htaccess-file">Remove WWW from the htaccess file</h3>
<p>Using this as a guide, I eventually removed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www</code> from the .htaccess directory (https://gist.github.com/bbrewer97202/3316425). That made it work.</p>

<h3 id="make-the-indexphp-redirect-to-indexhtml">Make the index.php redirect to index.html</h3>
<p>I made the file look  like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;?php
/* Redirect browser */
header("Location: /index.html");

/* Make sure that code below does not get executed when we redirect. */
exit;
?&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
