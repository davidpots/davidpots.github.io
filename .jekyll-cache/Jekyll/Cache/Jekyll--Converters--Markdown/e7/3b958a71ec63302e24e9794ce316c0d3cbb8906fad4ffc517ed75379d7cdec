I"ú<p>This tutorial will show you how to add a new column to an existing table in your Rails project database. Why would you do this? As you build out a project, you may realize that one of your data models may need to be added to â€“ which means a new column in that table. Hereâ€™s how to do this.</p>

<p>In the example below, Iâ€™m assuming you have a Rails project up and running with a table already created. In this case, I want to add a column for â€œRSS Feedâ€, in which Iâ€™ll enter a URL (string) value for each table entry.</p>

<p>Finally, note that these are merely my personal notes on learning about this. For official reference (that will stay up to date, as this post may not) refer to the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html">official Rails guide</a>.</p>

<h3 id="1-generate-the-migration">1. Generate the Migration</h3>

<p>First things first. After you know what type of column you wish to add, load up terminal and change into your projectâ€™s directory. Type this command to generate a new migration. This command includes the name of the migration weâ€™re creating, as well as the column name we wish to create (and the type of variable/value that column will accept). In this case the new column will be called <em>url_rss</em> and will be of type <em>string</em>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rails generate migration add_url_rss_to_shows url_rss:string 
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="2-confirm-the-migration-file-looks-okay">2. Confirm the migration file looks okay</h3>

<p>In your appâ€™s <em>db/migrate</em> folder youâ€™ll see a new file at the end of the list (with a timestamp matching when it was created). Before you do a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake db:migrate</code> youâ€™ll want to make sure the migration file is giving the proper instructions to the database. In this case, it looks okay:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class AddUrlRssToShows &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :shows, :url_rss, :string
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="3-migrate-the-database">3. Migrate the database</h3>

<p>By running the command below. This will run the migration, following the instructions specified in any yet-to-be-run migrations. Which in this case will add a column â€œurl_rssâ€ which is type â€œstringâ€ into the table â€œshowsâ€.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rake db:migrate
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="4-update-the-models-attr_accessible-values">4. Update the modelâ€™s attr_accessible values</h3>

<p>In my case, I need to go into shows.rb and update the â€œattr_accessibleâ€ line to include the new column name. At the moment Iâ€™m not able to explain exactly why this is necessary â€“ but without it, you canâ€™t edit/create Shows with the new property we just created. My Show.rb file now looks like this, with the only change being the â€œ:url_rssâ€ added to the attr_accessible line.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Show &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :description, :name, :url_web, :url_itunes, :url_rss, :network_id
  belongs_to :network
  has_many :episodes
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="5-update-the-_form-and-show-views-for-the-affected-model">5. Update the â€œ_formâ€ and â€œshowâ€ views for the affected model</h3>

<p>Now that the table column is added, we need to both (1) enable users to enter data for this column per each Show, and (2) display what they entered whenever a user is viewing a record. Two sub-steps here.</p>

<p>First, update the â€œ_formâ€ view (which is used when editing or creating a Show). I now have a new label and input field which accepts the string for â€œurl_rssâ€:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;div class="field"&gt;
  &lt;%= f.label :url_rss, "URL: RSS Feed" %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;%= f.text_field :url_rss %&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Second, update the â€œshowâ€ view (which is used to display a Showâ€™s details). I now need to output the url_rss value so users can benefit from this item.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;RSS URL:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  &lt;%= @show.url_rss.empty? ? "--" : @show.url_rss %&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="6-all-done">6. All Done!</h3>

<p>Youâ€™re finished. Now your table has a new column, and youâ€™re able to add values to this column via the appâ€™s web view (or via terminal).</p>
