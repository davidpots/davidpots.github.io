I am a podcast enthusiast who has been eagerly waiting for the release of <a href="http://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> by the one and only <a href="http://marco.org">Marco Arment</a>. Today was the day. After a bit of use, there's a few suggested tweaks I propose that would improve usability without (I think) shaking things up too much.

### Play Status, Unclear

This "Play Status" screen has confused me all day. It seems really important and powerful for governing how a playlist works, but something seemed off:

<img class="img-centered" style="width: 320px;" src="/images/blog/2014-07-17-overcast-reactions-day-one/1.png" />

Ultimately, I figured it out after some quick searching online –– it seems a common enough term in the parlance of certain podcast apps. But what doesn't make sense to me, and I would guess to anyone new to podcast listening, are the options Overcast presents on the Play Status screen. There are three individual play statuses inferred from the options here.

1. New
2. In Progress
3. Deleted

Of these three statuses, I'd argue only one of them is in fact a _play_ status: "In Progress". "New" pertains to an _episode_, as does "Deleted". Putting these options under the umbrella of "Play Status" isn't clear to users who aren't already familiar with the term. And even still, it seems off.

A proposal: rename this screen "Episode Status". Immediately, all three status apply perfectly and make great sense.

- "New" episodes
- "In progress" episodes
- "Deleted" episodes

No confusion here.

### Played and Unplayed

I'd then suggest Marco take it one step further: add an "Episode Status" option to show all most recent episodes, regardless of their played or unplayed status. This lets users, should they wish, view a list of the all most recent episodes from the podcasts they select -- identical to the "Most Recent" screen on the Apple Podcast app.

<img class="img-centered" style="width: 320px;" src="/images/blog/2014-07-17-overcast-reactions-day-one/3.png" />

In Overcast, this could be achieved by simply adding another option to the "Episode Status" page:

I believe this playlist ability would add a lot of value to Overcast. Examples from my personal experience:

- Sometimes I want to survey the most recent batch of episodes from all my feeds, and get a sense of which ones I've listened to vs. which ones are yet unplayed. Showing them both at once helps achieve this.
- Sometimes I want to re-listen to an episode I listened to recently. Maybe it is a music podcast, maybe I fell asleep or wasn't paying attention on the prior listen, or maybe it was a great episode and I want to go back for more.
- Sometimes I want to retroactively curate really good episodes from recent listening. Let me browse the episodes I've listened to recently and cherry pick, from a central playlist location, the ones I want to save or share or recommend.

With all this said, users could still remove episodes (via swipe). And furthermore, a "Play Status" screen could then be possibly used as an _additional_ setting per the playlist -- but this time, having its options actually pertain to play status, and not episode status.

And there we have it.

### Buckets of Podcasts

This played / unplayed schism, and the resulting confusion, goes further a bit more. To close things out, I'll leave this screenshot which I think is a step away from the light of clarity:

<img class="img-centered" style="width: 320px;" src="/images/blog/2014-07-17-overcast-reactions-day-one/6.png" />

I see the "Podcasts" heading and understand what that bucket must contain (all my podcasts, right?), but then see the "Played Podcasts" bucket and have to retroactively recalculate my mental model of things. Does this mean the first bucket is showing _unplayed_ podcasts? It would seem so.

And again, here is another situation where episodes are being represented by another term. Not that I'm suggesting as much, but these two buckets would more accurately be titled "Podcasts with Unplayed Episodes" and "Podcasts with no unplayed episodes". Doesn't feel right. 

This isn't a perfect solution to this problem, but these labels would make more sense (though perhaps feeling a bit unpolished):

<img class="img-centered" style="width: 320px;" src="/images/blog/2014-07-17-overcast-reactions-day-one/7.png" />

And at the end of the day, is there a way for me to simply view a list of all my podcast feeds in a single batch? Whether or not I have – within each feed – episodes played or unplayed? This seems like a no-brainer to me, though it isn't possible within Overcast right now (as far as I can tell).

That's it! Lastly, I want to close out by emphasizing that I'm thrilled with Overcast so far. I sincerely cannot wait to see where Marco takes it. Nice work, good sir. We are lucky to have you.
