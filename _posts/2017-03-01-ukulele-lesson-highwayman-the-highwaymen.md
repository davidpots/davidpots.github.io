## Lyrics with chords

    Bm         A                     G                 Bm
    ...I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
    A                     G      D     A
    ...With the sword and pistol by my side
    Em        Bm                  A             G
    ...Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
    Em        Bm               A                G
    ...Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
    Bm              A              G         A      D
    ...The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
        G            A
    But I am still alive


    Bm         A                 G             Bm
    ...I was a sailor, and I was born upon the tide
    A               G     D    A
    ...And with the sea I did abide
    Em            Bm                  A           G
    ...I sailed a schooner around the horn of Mexico
    Em         Bm               A             G
    ...I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
    Bm              A                    G        A     D
    ...And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
        G           A
    But I am living still


    Bm         A                       G              Bm
    ...I was a dam builder, across the river deep and wide
    A                  G     D       A
    ...Where steel and water did collide
    Em                Bm             A          G
    ...A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
    Em               Bm            A              G
    ...I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
    Bm             A                G         A        D
    ...They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
        G           A
    But I am still around

                        D
        I'll always be around
             A          Bm         A      G    D    Em     G  A  D
        And around and around and around

    Bm            A                    G          Bm
    ...I'll fly a starship, across the universe divide
    A          G         D     A
    ...Until I reach the other side
    Em             Bm               A           G
    ...I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
    Em           Bm           A           G
    ...Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
    Bm          A           G      A       D
    ...Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
    G            A
    But I will remain

                          D
        And I'll be back again
             A          Bm         A      G    D    Em     G  A  D
        And again, and again, and again
