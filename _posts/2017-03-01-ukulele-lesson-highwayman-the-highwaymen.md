## About this song

Obviously, this is a song you typically hear played on the guitar -- but while learning it on guitar, I happened to be going through a ukulele phase and couldn't help but figure it out on that instrument too. I figured, why not share what I'd learned! I find it's a bit simpler on the ukulele: lots of little embellishments I add while playing on the guitar aren't needed (or aren't even practically possible) on the ukulele -- so it makes for a nice cut and dry song. You only need five chords.

## Chords you'll need

    A ||––––0––––2––––0––––2–––––2––––
    E ||––––2––––3––––0––––2–––––3––––
    C ||––––2––––2––––1––––2–––––4––––
    G ||––––2––––0––––2––––4–––––0––––
            D    G    A    Bm    Em

## Strumming pattern

I would start with four simple down strums, one on each beat (and repeat that). If you want to get a little bit spicier, I recommend this -- where the accents come on beats 2 and 4.

            >               >   
    ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓ ↑ ↓   ↓   ↓   ↓ ↑
    1   +   2   +   3   +   4   +   


## Lyrics with chords

    Bm         A                     G                 Bm
    ...I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
    A                     G      D     A
    ...With the sword and pistol by my side
    Em        Bm                  A             G
    ...Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
    Em        Bm               A                G
    ...Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
    Bm              A              G         A      D
    ...The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
        G            A
    But I am still alive


    Bm         A                 G             Bm
    ...I was a sailor, and I was born upon the tide
    A               G     D    A
    ...And with the sea I did abide
    Em            Bm                  A           G
    ...I sailed a schooner around the horn of Mexico
    Em         Bm               A             G
    ...I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
    Bm              A                    G        A     D
    ...And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
        G           A
    But I am living still


    Bm         A                       G              Bm
    ...I was a dam builder, across the river deep and wide
    A                  G     D       A
    ...Where steel and water did collide
    Em                Bm             A          G
    ...A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
    Em               Bm            A              G
    ...I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
    Bm             A                G         A        D
    ...They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
        G           A
    But I am still around

                        D
        I'll always be around
             A          Bm         A      G    D    Em     G  A  D
        And around and around and around

    Bm            A                    G          Bm
    ...I'll fly a starship, across the universe divide
    A          G         D     A
    ...Until I reach the other side
    Em             Bm               A           G
    ...I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
    Em           Bm           A           G
    ...Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
    Bm          A           G      A       D
    ...Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
    G            A
    But I will remain

                          D
        And I'll be back again
             A          Bm         A      G    D    Em     G  A  D
        And again, and again, and again
