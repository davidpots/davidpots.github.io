### How to play the chords on ukulele
The ukulele chords you'll need (in the order you'll need them) are as follows. All the notes I have in parentheses you can technically mute (i.e., lay a finger over the string so it doesn't ring) and it'll sound just fine -- this'll make things far easier, especially if you're newer to ukulele.

    A-|---0---(2)---4----4---(0)---0---(0)--(2)---
    E-|---0----4----5----4----2----0----2----4----
    C-|---1----4----6----5----2----1----2----4----
    G-|---2----4---(6)---6----2----2----2----4----
          A    E   F#m   C#   D    A    D    E 


### Chords in context with lyrics
Here's the first stanza of the song shown in proper time with the chords. If you're just learning this, an important tip: you'll want to barre the 4th fret with your index finger for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th chords in this 8-chord sequence (your middle- and -ring fingers will be used for the other notes in the chords). Also note the little riff you can do on the F#m and C# chords.

    A-|---0------------(2)-----------------4--4--7--4----4-----------|-
    E-|---0-------------4------------------5-------------4--4--7--4--|-
    C-|---1-------------4------------------6-------------5-----------|-

          A             E                 F#m            C# 
         "...It doesn't matter what I say..."
