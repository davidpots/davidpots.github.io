## The core of this lesson

In this lesson, I'll show you how to walk up from E to A, from A to B7, and from B7 back down to A and E. In my video portion of the lesson, here's the quick demo I play at the beginning where I preview this simple technique.

    E –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––––––––0–––––0–––––0––––––––
    B –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––––––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––
    G –––––1–––––1–––––1–––––––––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––
    D –––––2–––––2–––––2–––––––––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––
    A –––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––0––0––0––0––0––0––0––1––
    E ––0––0––0––0––0––0––2––4––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        E                       A


    E –––––2–––––2–––––2–––––––––––0–––––0––––0–––––––––
    B –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––––––––0–––––0––––3–––––––––
    G –––––2–––––2–––––2–––––––––––1–––––1––––1–––––––––
    D –––––1–––––1–––––1–––––––––––2–––––2––––2–––––––––
    A ––2––2––2––2––2––2–––––––––––2–––––2––––2–––––––––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––4––2––0––0––0––0––––0–––––––––
        B7                      E             E7

For a very simple deconstruction of what's going on here, refer to this tab. Note the bass notes between the chords! That's what I want to focus on -- these transitional bass notes.

    E ––0–––––––––––0–––––––––––2––––––––0–––––––––––0––
    B ––0–––––––––––2–––––––––––0––––––––2–––––––––––0––
    G ––1–––––––––––2–––––––––––2––––––––2–––––––––––1––
    D ––2–––––––––––2–––––––––––1––––––––2–––––––––––2––
    A ––2–––––––––––0––0––1––2––2––2––1––0––0––––––––2––
    E ––0––0––2––4–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––4––2––0––
        E           A           B7       A           E

## Chords I'm using

By the way, if you need to worry about learning the chords I'm using here, refer to these tabs:

    E ––––0–––––––0––––––2–––––
    B ––––0–––––––2––––––0–––––
    G ––––1–––––––2––––––2–––––
    D ––––2–––––––2––––––1–––––
    A ––––2–––––––0––––––2–––––
    E ––––0––––––––––––––––––––
          E       A      B7

## How to learn and practice this

If your'e just getting started with this run, first worry about E and A (don't bring in B7 yet). Repeat this sequence, going from E to A and back down to E. Repeat.

    E –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––––––––0–––––0–––––0––––––––
    B –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––––––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––
    G –––––1–––––1–––––1–––––––––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––
    D –––––2–––––2–––––2–––––––––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––
    A –––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––0––0––0––0––0––0––––––––
    E ––0––0––0––0––0––0––2––4––––––––––––––––––––4––2––
        E                       A

Then, worry about going from A to B7 and back to A. Repeat.

    E –––––0–––––0–––––0–––––––––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––
    B –––––2–––––2–––––2–––––––––––0–––––0–––––0––––––––
    G –––––2–––––2–––––2–––––––––––2–––––2–––––2––––––––
    D –––––2–––––2–––––2–––––––––––1–––––1–––––1––––––––
    A ––0––0––0––0––0––0––0––1––2––2––2––2––2––2––2––1––
    E ––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
        A                       B7          

When you've mastered these two transitions, you can do the full E to A to B7 back down to A and E.

## Having trouble with the middle and ring fingers?

When playing the bass notes, I strongly recommend using your middle and ring fingers (in addition to your index finger). While you technically can pull this off using _only_ your index finger, it's a bad habit that I suggest avoiding. You need to train your weaker fingers (middle, ring, pinky) -- and though it can be frustrating at first it pays off later.

Here's a simple exericse I suggest:

    E –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    B –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    G –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
    D –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––   ...repeat
    A –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––   
    E –––2––3––4––3––2––3––4––3––––

    2nd fret = index finger
    3rd fret = middle finger
    4th fret = ring finger

Repeat that.

## Songs that use this sort of transition

### Walk the Line

"Walk the Line" by Johnny Cash is a powerhouse example of this technique used a ton. Here's the first few measures. See [my full lesson](http://www.songnotes.cc/songs/149-johnny-cash-i-walk-the-line) on this song if you want to learn it in full.

    E –––––––––––0–––0––––––––––––2–––2––––––––––––0––––
    B –––––––––––2–––2––––––––––––3–––3––––––––––––2––––
    G –––––––––––2–––2––––––––––––2–––2––––––––––––2––––
    D –––––––––––2–––2–––––––––0––0–––––0–0––––––––2––––
    A ––––––––0––0–––––0–0–2–4––––––0–––––––4–2–0––0––––
    E ––0–2–4––––––0––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
                 A                D                A

### Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground

"Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground" by Willie Nelson has a similar run with these notes:

    E –––0––––––––––––––––––––––––0––––
    B –––0––––––––––––––––––––––––2––––
    G –––1––––––––––––––––––––––––2––––
    D –––2––––––––––––––––––––––––2––––
    A –––2–––––––––––––––––––0––––0––––
    E –––0–––0–––1–––2–––4–––––––––––––

Here's a great breakdown of the precise style Willie uses when playing this sort of run:
