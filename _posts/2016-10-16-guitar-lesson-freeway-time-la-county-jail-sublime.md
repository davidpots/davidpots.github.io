    VERSE, PART 1

               E
        On the freeway in the county, the sun don’t shine
               E
        ... ..I feel, I feel, I feel... I feel a bati man
               E                           (+ riff)
         ....Outside my cell, deputies creep
               E                         
        ...And in this cell... all I do
               A                     
        ....Is sleep... and I dream...
               A                   (+ riff)
        .............That I’m free...
               A
        And I’m back on the reef where I...

    VERSE, PART 2

              E
            I throw my net out into the sea
                C#m7                    Bsus4
            And all the fine hinas come swimmin’ to me
                 G#
            They hold me and they promise me things
                         C#
            And when the tides high I cry like a little baby
                             C
            Don’t give me no right kinda loving no Sunday morning
            B
            ...Don’t want no puppy loving

    VERSE, PART 3

                A7
                Hold me babe, the new stylee
                E
                Hold me babe, the new stylee
                     A
                And a... an angry dog is an hungry dog
                     E
                And a... a hungry dog is a angry dog
                  C                                         G    B7
                I feel like rockin', I wanna rock with you

      I--- gotta contact home, gotta contact my... baby girl
      But I would, never could, get up
      Why does it have to be so damn tough
      With mayates and the eses, yes they’re steady on the fall
      I’ll be damned if the man with the shank in his hand
      Will make me feel, I feel, a bati man... and I know...
      That I’m there... someday... I’m...

          Back on the reef where I throw my net out into the sea
          All the fine hinas come swimmin’ to me 
          Hold me baby, promise me
          With no protection of my erection I wont get no VD
          Don’t give me no right kinda loving, no Sunday morning
          I don’t want no puppy loving

              Hungry babe are the new stylee
              Angry dog is a hungry doggies
              A naked man is a naked man
              A wicked dog is a hungry dog 
              I feel like rocking, I wanna rock with you
