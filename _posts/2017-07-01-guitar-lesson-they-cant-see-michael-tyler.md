## Chords needed

You'll need to be able to play these chords. The C#m is most certainly going to the hardest of these, especially if you've never played barre chords before. If this vexes you, stay tuned -- you can likely fake your way through the song and pull off the C#m without barring the full 4th fret.

    E ––––0–––––4–––––0–––––0–––––
    B ––––0–––––5–––––2–––––0–––––
    G ––––1–––––6–––––2–––––2–––––
    D ––––2–––––6–––––2–––––2–––––
    A ––––2–––––4–––––0–––––0–––––
    E ––––0–––––––––––––––––––––––
          E    C#m    A   Asus2      

## Main progression

Pretty much the entire song uses this riff. You're on each of these chords for a single measure (4 counts!), but what makes things interesting is

    E –|–––––––––––––––|––––––––(4)––––|–––––––––––––––|––––––––––(0)––|–
    B –|–––––––––––––––|––5––––––––––––|––2––0–––––––––|––0––––––––––––|–
    G –|––1––––––––––––|––6––––––––––––|––2––2–––––––––|––1––––––––––––|–
    D –|––2––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––|–
    A –|–––––––––––––––|––4––––––––––––|––0––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––|–
    E –|––0––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––|–––––––––––––––|––0––––––––––––|–
          E               C#m             A               E

Understand that for each chord above, your left hand should be in the normal position for that chord -- but on your picking hand, your fingers are only targeting the strings that need to be played.

    E ––(0)–––
    B ––(0)–––
    G –––1––––  <-- right middle finger
    D –––2––––  <-- right index finger
    A ––(2)–––
    E –––0––––  <-- right thumb
         E            

## Bridge chords

You'll also need an F#m and B chords for the bridge (in addition to a C#m, which is shown above). Use the same strumming / fingerpicking approach shown above for those chords. If you can't play a regular B, you can sub in a B7.

    –––2––––2––––2––––
    –––2––––4––––0––––
    –––2––––4––––2––––
    –––4––––4––––1––––
    –––4––––2––––2––––
    –––2––––––––––––––
      F#m   B    B7

## That's it!

I hope this was helpful! This is a fun song -- and that single progression isn't a ton to memorize. Enjoy.
