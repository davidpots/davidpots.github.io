## Chords needed

You'll need to be able to play these chords. The C#m is most certainly going to the hardest of these, especially if you've never played barre chords before. If this vexes you, stay tuned -- you can likely fake your way through the song and pull off the C#m without barring the full 4th fret.

## Main progression

Pretty much the entire song uses this riff. You're on each of these chords for a single measure (4 counts!), but what makes things interesting is
