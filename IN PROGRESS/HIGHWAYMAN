I was a highwayman, along the coach roads I did ride
With the sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his life blood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor, and I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner around the horn of Mexico
I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they say that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder, across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around

    I'll always be around
    And around and around and around

I'll fly a starship, across the universe divide
Until I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain

    And I'll be back again
    And again, and again, and again
