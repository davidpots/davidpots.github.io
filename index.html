    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Since 2005, I've worked professionally to apply my UX/UI design and front-end development skills toward non-profit, enterprise, and consumer web projects. Currently, I'm an Interaction Designer on the UX team at LivingSocial in Washington, DC. Outside of work, I'm a proud family man who enjoys podcasts and loves <a href="http://www.songnotes.cc">playing the guitar</a>.</p>

    <h3>Featured Project</h3>
    <div class="project">
      <h4><a href="http://www.songnotes.cc">Songnotes</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">Curated Digital Songbook + Rails CMS</p>
      <p>I designed &amp; developed Songnotes to help me share my growing collection of curated guitar tabs, chords, lyrics, and lessons with aspiring musicians across the world. To do this, I built a Rails-powered CMS that feeds my hand-crafted song metadata snippets into a carefully designed framework that was built to support the structure of any song.</p>

      <a href="http://www.songnotes.cc/songs/135-elton-john-rocket-man"><img class="img-work img-centered" src="/images/work/sn3.png" /></a>
      <p>fruit launching Songnotes in December 2012, I have personally added each of the 125+ songs on the site. The content for each song entry is hand-crafted by me personally, ensuring a high-quality, consistent, and media-rich experience that works for today's web-native audience.</p>

    <h3>Other Projects</h3>
    <div class="project">
      <h4><a href="http://davidpots.com/wisp">Wisp</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">Ultra-Lightweight HTML/CSS Starter Kit</p>
      <p>Wisp is an ultra-lightweight HTML framework to help you quickstart any project or rapid prototype. Quite simply, it sets up a generic project directory with an index.html file already linked to the usual CSS and jQuery resources. For simple projects where Rails or the HTML5 Boilerplate is overkill, Wisp helps you hit the ground running without any overhead.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h4><a href="http://davidpots.com/fireflygrove">Firefly Grove</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">Songwriting Project + Soundcloud Playground</p>
      <p>Firefly Grove is a personal songwriting project showcasing 9 lo-fi folk songs I wrote &amp; recorded dating back to 2008-2009. From a technical viewpoint, I used this project as an opportunity to introduce myself with the Soundcloud API &amp; SDK while also exploring some jQuery layout techniques.</p>
