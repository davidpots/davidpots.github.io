    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Since 2005, I've worked professionally to apply my UX/UI design and front-end development skills toward non-profit, enterprise, and consumer web projects. I currently work as a Product Designer at LearnZillion in Washington, DC. Outside of work, I'm a proud family man who <a href="http://podcrawler.com">enjoys podcasts</a> and loves <a href="http://www.songnotes.cc">playing the guitar</a>.</p>

    <h3>Featured Project</h3>
    <div class="project">
      <h4><a href="http://www.songnotes.cc">Songnotes</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">Curated Digital Songbook + Rails CMS</p>
      <p>I designed &amp; developed Songnotes to help me share my growing collection of curated guitar tabs, chords, lyrics, and lessons with aspiring musicians across the world. To do this, I built a Rails-powered CMS that feeds my hand-crafted song metadata snippets into a carefully designed framework that was built to support the structure of any song.</p>
      <p>Since launching Songnotes in December 2012, I have personally added each of the 150+ songs on the site. The content for each song entry is hand-crafted by me personally, ensuring a high-quality, consistent, and media-rich experience that works for today's web-native audience.</p>

    <h3>Other Projects</h3>
    <div class="project">
      <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/playsongnotes/videos">Songnotes Video Guitar Lessons</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">Guitar Tutorials &amp; Instruction via YouTube</p>
      <p>In November 2013, feeling inspired by YouTube stars <a href="http://www.youtube.com/justinsandercoe">Justin Sandercoe</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/guitarjamzdotcom">Marty Schwartz</a>, I began creating high quality video lessons to accompany and enrich the content my Songnotes website. In the first 8 weeks, I recorded 15+ video lessons showing in precise detail how to play some of the popular songs on Songnotes. After three months, the videos in total have so far generated over 135k views, nearly 1000 subscribers, and maintain an average viewership of 2 minutes per video.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h4><a href="http://podcrawler.com">PodCrawler</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">iTunes Podcast Search, Made Easy</p>
      <p>Inspired by Marco Arment's <a href="http://preview.fm">Preview.fm</a> project, I created PodCrawler to give users an elegant &amp; no-nonsense experience for searching iTunes podcasts. PodCrawler was built on Rails, using the Feedzirra and iTunes-API gems to retrieve and parse feeds. It is stripped of non-essential features and aims to do one thing very well: letting you browse podcasts.</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h4><a href="http://davidpots.com/gifparade">GIF Parade</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">Combine Multiple Animated GIFs + YouTube Audio</p>
      <p>Inspired by Garrett Miller's <a href="http://loudgif.com">LoudGIF</a> project, I created GIF Parade as an experiment in figuring out how to display not one, but multiple animated GIFs in succession backed by audio from a YouTube track. This also served as a terrific playground to further my Javascript skills while also delving into using the Bitly and YouTube APIs for the first time. Check out some sample GIF Parades <a href="http://t.co/yYGGQppZgN">here</a>, <a href="http://t.co/iUjgxYjzeZ">here</a>, and <a href="http://t.co/uYS5dwfwgl">here</a>... or make your own!</p>

    <div class="project">
      <h4><a href="http://davidpots.com/wisp">Wisp</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">Ultra-Lightweight HTML/CSS Starter Kit</p>
      <p>Wisp is an ultra-lightweight HTML framework to help you quickstart any project or rapid prototype. Quite simply, it sets up a generic project directory with an index.html file already linked to the usual CSS and jQuery resources. For simple projects where Rails or the HTML5 Boilerplate is overkill, Wisp helps you hit the ground running without any overhead.</p>

      <h4><a href="http://davidpots.com/fireflygrove">Firefly Grove</a></h4>
      <p class="sub">Songwriting Project + Soundcloud Playground</p>
      <p>Firefly Grove is a personal songwriting project showcasing 9 lo-fi folk songs I wrote &amp; recorded dating back to 2008-2009. From a technical viewpoint, I used this project as an opportunity to introduce myself with the Soundcloud API &amp; SDK while also exploring some jQuery layout techniques.</p>
