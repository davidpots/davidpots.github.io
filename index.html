  <h3>About</h3>  
  <p>Since 2005, I've worked professionally to combine my UX/UI design and front-end development skills toward non-profit, enterprise, and consumer web projects. Currently, I'm a proud member of the UX team at LivingSocial, where I help design products and interactions for screens of all sizes. Outside of work, I'm a proud family man who enjoys podcasts and loves <a href="http://www.songnotes.cc" target="_blank">playing the guitar</a>.</p>

  <h3>Featured Project</h3>
  <div class="project">
    <h4><a target="_blank" href="http://www.songnotes.cc">Songnotes</a></h4>
    <p>I designed &amp; developed Songnotes to help me share my growing collection of curated guitar tabs, chords, lyrics, and lessons with aspiring musicians across the world. To do this, I built a Rails-powered CMS that feeds my hand-crafted song metadata snippets into a carefully designed framework that was built to support the structure of any song. The result is high-quality, consistent, and media-rich music notation that works for today's web-native audience.</p>

  <h3>Other Projects</h3>
  <div class="project">
    <h4><a href="http://davidpots.com/wisp">Wisp</a></h4>
    <p>Wisp is an ultra-lightweight HTML framework to help you quickstart any project or rapid prototype. Quite simply, it sets up a generic project directory with an index.html file already linked to the usual CSS and jQuery resources. For simple projects where Rails or the HTML5 Boilerplate is overkill, Wisp helps you hit the ground running without any overhead.</p>

  <div class="project">
    <h4><a href="http://davidpots.com/fireflygrove">Firefly Grove</a></h4>
    <p>Firefly Grove is a personal songwriting project showcasing 9 lo-fi folk songs I wrote &amp; recorded dating back to 2008-2009. From a technical viewpoint, I used this project as an opportunity to introduce myself with the Soundcloud API &amp; SDK while also exploring some jQuery layout techniques.</p>
