# Welcome to Wisp

Wisp is a super-simple HTML/CSS/JS template intended to give you a quick-start on new projects. It is intentionally lean and lightweight. Ideal for rapid prototyping.

### Why I made this

Very often I want to dive immediately into a project requiring a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS setup, and I grew tired of having to dig up the proper structure for including jQuery or the proper meta tags or having a mega-basic CSS framework in place. While tons of great frameworks are already out there, they all seem like overkill given what I need. 

I wanted to make something myself, as lightweight as possible, built entirely for my needs. I am surely repeating the work others have already done -- but I'm also getting good experience in creating this and putting it to use.

### How I made this

I modeled the core of Wisp on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), after stripping away a lot of markup I don't usually need when quickly throwing together prototypes.

Bye!
